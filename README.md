flash-stm32f407
===============

A ChibiOS/RT based library providing read/write operations on the STM32F407 flash memory.

This work is greatly inspired by mabl's bootloader example at:
https://github.com/mabl/ARMCM3-STM32F107-BOOTLOADER

An Intel HEX file parser is provided (written by Vanya A. Sergeev <vsergeev@gmail.com>)
with a helper function to flash an IHex file from FatFS into flash memory.
